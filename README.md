## My Participation Repo

Welcome to my Participation Repo! Here you will find all in class material from the Data Analytics class I took. I learned an unbelievable amount this semester, and the following topics were covered in depth:
- General use of Github, markdown features, and how to use GH desktop.

- Data wrangling and exploration using tools such as numpy and pandas.

- Cleaning and organizing data.

- Presenting useful visualizations of the data, primarily using seaborn.

- Merging data sets.

- Scraping data from the web and parsing through it.

- Building prediction models and conducting data analysis using tools such as sklearn for regressions.

The contents of my repo are made up of files that cover this material, and are organized as follows:
- Codebook:Contains "coding recipes". These are tips I found useful, or techniques I especially want to remember.

- Homework: This file contains after class practice.

- Livecodings: All of our coding done in class during lectures can be found here.

- Misc: Any other files from class.

- This readme!

I hope you enjoy reading my repo, and find it helpful in one way or another!
